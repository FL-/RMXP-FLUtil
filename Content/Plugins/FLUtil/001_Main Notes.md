This script is for RPG Maker XP. It adds a lot of useful classes and methods:
- RandomHelper who make doing things like raffle a lot easier
- Variable Switches Alias, who makes switch/variable access shorter and more readable
- Tween system
- Multiversion/non-essentials layer (partial)
- Misc classes and methods
Works with Essentials. Works also with PSDK (only the first three).

## How to use
Look at each file header instructions.

## Notes
The files are:
- 001_Main Notes.md - This file, only with instructions
- 002_RandomHelper.rb - Requires 006_EsBridge.rb
- 003_Variables Switches Alias.rb
- 004_MyAlias.rb - Editable part of 003_Variables Switches Alias.rb
- 005_Tweener.rb
- 006_EsBridge.rb
- 007_Misc Util.rb - Requires 006_EsBridge.rb
- 008_Test.rb - Used to me to quickly test stuff, so requires all other files, except 005_Tweener.rb.

All files works without Essentials, some in very limited way. 

To update this script to a newer version, replaces all files except 004_MyAlias.rb.
